ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
E:\This is Project\AndroidProjectFromGame\MyApplication
       -  -                                            

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .project~
* README.md
* README.md~
* docs\
* docs\images\
* docs\images\big\
* docs\images\big\edu.png
* docs\images\big\trivia.png
* docs\images\big\wp_1p.png
* docs\images\big\wp_2p.png
* docs\images\big\wp_spinner.png
* docs\images\big\wp_wiki.png
* docs\images\edu.png
* docs\images\trivia.png
* docs\images\wp_1p.png
* docs\images\wp_2p.png
* docs\images\wp_spinner.png
* docs\images\wp_wiki.png
* ic_launcher-web.png
* readme.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => androidquiztemplate\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\achartengine-1.0.0.jar => androidquiztemplate\libs\achartengine-1.0.0.jar
* lint.xml => androidquiztemplate\lint.xml
* res\ => androidquiztemplate\src\main\res\
* src\ => androidquiztemplate\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
